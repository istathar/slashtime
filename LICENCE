1) slashtime source code and documentation
------------------------------------------

slashtime is Logiciel Libre and is Open Source; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 ("GPL"),
with the exception that external third party libraries used by slashtime do not
need to be licenced under GPL so long as they are redistributable under an Open
Source licence.

slashtime is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A

you use this and loose your data, you're on your own.

Of course, if you find a bug, please let us know. And, if you fix anything or

2) prerequisites and dependencies
---------------------------------

slashtime depends on a number of external libraries. They are either provided by
your operating system distribution or, in some cases, are shipped alongside the
slashtime sources in the lib/ subdirectory. That code is open source (or we
couldn't have redistributed it), but note that third party sources are made
available under the terms specified by their authors and as documented in the
individual licences within those files, as noted below and in lib/README.

3) use of Java
--------------

slashtime is written in the Java programming language. You have the option of
building and running slashtime either using the proprietary compilers and
runtime environments are available from Sun and others, or using the libre and
open Java implementation available through GCJ and the GNU CLASSPATH (aka glibj)
project. We welcome you to deploy slashtime using either approach.
