# 
# Purpose
# -------
#
# The whole point of this file is to allow you to mark a zone with a name that
# means something to you. We don't all happen to live in the place that just
# happens to be the reference location for this timezone. Likewise, sometimes
# the official country name isn't quite how you think of the place; perhaps
# you'd rather there be just the abbreviation, etc.
#
# Each line will be translated to a Place and displayed in the ZonesWindow by
# slashtime. Keep the list below 20 or so; if you don't, it won't fit on
# screen vertically.
#
# Format
# ------
#
# This file is three columns, TAB separated. Each column should be enclosed
# in double quote characters, ie:
#
# "Zone"	"City"	"Country"
#
# The zoneinfo parameter is the path name of a zoneinfo file relative to
# /usr/share/zoneinfo. The structure of that data is Continent/Location, with
# there generally being one per country per timezone. Examples:
#
# "Australia/Sydney"	"Sydney"	"Australia"
# "Asia/Calcutta"	"Bangalore"	"India"
# "Pacific/Honolulu"	"Hawaii"	"USA"
# "America/Edmonton"	"Calgary"	"Canada"
#
# Note that "Europe/London" is *not* UTC, and vice versa; British Summer Time
# applies in London, but does not impact Universal Time.
#
# You do not need to include UTC; it is needed by the program and
# added automatically at runtime.
